    <h2>About London</h2>
    <p>
      London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is one of the world’s most visited and influential cities. 
      Located on the River Thames, it has been a major settlement for over two millennia. London is a true melting pot 
      of cultures, with over 300 languages spoken across its neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <h2>The History of London</h2>
    <p>
      London was founded by the Romans around AD 47, who named it *Londinium*. 
      Over the centuries, it grew into a thriving trade center and the heart of the British Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city has seen monumental events: the Great Fire of London in 1666, the Blitz during World War II, 
      and the remarkable rebuilding that followed. Each era left its mark — from medieval architecture to 
      modern skyscrapers like The Shard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, London seamlessly blends its ancient heritage with contemporary design and multicultural life, 
      attracting millions of tourists and professionals from all over the world.
